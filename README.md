# Student Information Console Application
This project is a simple console application written in C# (.NET framework) that demonstrates the implementation of a Student class. The class contains properties for the student's name, ID, and age. Additionally, it includes a method, GetInformation(), which returns a concatenated string of the student's name, ID, and age.

# Features
Student Class: The Student class has properties for name, ID, and age, with getter and setter methods to access and modify the values.
GetInformation Method: The class includes a GetInformation() method that returns a string containing the concatenated name, ID, and age of the student.

# Instructions
To run the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Visual Studio (compatible with C# and .NET framework).
Build and run the application.
The application will create an array of 10 Student objects and display the information (name, ID, and age) for each student using the GetInformation() method.
